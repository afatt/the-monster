# the-monster
A repository for trying out new concepts and examples to try out in C/C++, Java, and Python. Everything in here should be overly annotated.
I will try to create unittests for all code. 

## Python
All python packages were kept in a virtual environment (venv) called the-monster
All python development will be done in a branch (python-devel)

## C++
All C+++ development will be done in a branch (cpp-devel)


## Java
All Java development will be done in a branch (java-devel)
